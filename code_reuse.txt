- There is alot of code reuse in this example program. For one example the Scanner class is used in this program along with the Stack class. The Scanner class is used to take in user input vice having to do it manually. In addition the Stack class exposed many different operations to the programmer without having to implement all the code yourself. For example this example program uses the .push method of the Stack class to easily add each member into the Stack. This is much easier than reinventing the wheel and having to manually create the Java method to properly add items to a stack. This cuts down on programming errors and potential vulnerabilities in a given program
